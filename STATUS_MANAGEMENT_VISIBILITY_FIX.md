# Complaint Admin Status Management Access Fix

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Problem Identified

### Issue: Custom Status Management Section Hidden from Complaint Admins

**User Report:**
> "Where is the button to change the status message of the client complaint? And the section to create custom status complaints? Just like the ones in admin"

**Root Cause:**
The `StatusManagement` component (which allows creating and managing custom complaint statuses) was only visible to full admin users. The dashboard component had a hardcoded check:

```typescript
{userRole === 'admin' && (
  <StatusManagement userRole={userRole} />
)}
```

This meant that users with `can_manage_categories` complaint admin permission couldn't access the custom status management section, even though:
1. The `StatusManagement` component already had the logic to check for `can_manage_categories` permission
2. The backend API already allows complaint admins with this permission to create/edit statuses
3. The modal already allows complaint admins to UPDATE complaint statuses to custom ones

**Impact:**
- Complaint admins with `can_manage_categories` permission couldn't create new custom statuses
- They couldn't edit existing custom statuses
- They could only use custom statuses that admins had already created
- This created an unnecessary dependency on full admins for routine status management tasks

---

## Solution Implemented

### Fix: Show Status Management to Users with Permission

**File:** `v0-micro-system/components/complaints/complaints-dashboard.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

#### 1. Added Missing Permission Fields
Updated the `complaintAdminPermissions` state type to include all permission fields:

```typescript
const [complaintAdminPermissions, setComplaintAdminPermissions] = useState<{
  has_permission: boolean;
  can_assign: boolean;
  can_change_status: boolean;
  can_delete: boolean;              // ✅ Added
  can_manage_categories: boolean;   // ✅ Added
} | null>(null)
```

#### 2. Updated Default Permission Values
Fixed the error handler to set all permission fields:

```typescript
setComplaintAdminPermissions({
  has_permission: false,
  can_assign: false,
  can_change_status: false,
  can_delete: false,              // ✅ Added
  can_manage_categories: false,   // ✅ Added
})
```

#### 3. Updated Render Condition
Changed the conditional rendering to check for the specific permission:

```typescript
{/* Status Management for Admins and Complaint Admins with permission */}
{(userRole === 'admin' || complaintAdminPermissions?.can_manage_categories) && (
  <StatusManagement userRole={userRole} />
)}
```

**Before:**
- Only `userRole === 'admin'` could see the section

**After:**
- `userRole === 'admin'` can see the section
- OR users with `complaintAdminPermissions?.can_manage_categories` can see it

---

## How It Works Now

### For Users with can_manage_categories Permission

#### 1. Custom Status Management Section Appears
When a complaint admin with `can_manage_categories` permission opens the complaints dashboard, they will now see the "Custom Status Management" card at the top of the page.

#### 2. Full Status Management Capabilities
Users can now:
- ✅ **Create new custom statuses** - Click "Create New Status" button
- ✅ **Edit existing statuses** - Click edit button on any status
- ✅ **Delete statuses** - Remove statuses they created
- ✅ **Set display order** - Control how statuses appear in dropdowns
- ✅ **Toggle active/inactive** - Enable or disable statuses
- ✅ **Add descriptions** - Provide context for each status

#### 3. Statuses Appear Immediately
Any custom statuses created by complaint admins will immediately appear:
- In the status dropdown in complaint detail modals
- In the status management list
- Available for all complaint admins to use

## Complete Status Management Flow

### Location 1: Complaints Dashboard (NEW - Now Visible)
**Path:** `/dashboard/complaints`

**What Users See:**

- Toggle status active/inactive state
- Delete custom statuses

### Location 2: Complaint Detail Modal - Actions Tab (Already Working)
**Path:** Click any complaint → "Actions" tab → "Update Status" section

**What Users See:**
- "Select New Status" dropdown showing all statuses (default + custom)
- "Status Update Notes" textarea for adding context
- "Update to: [Status Name]" button

---

## Permission Requirements

### To See Status Management Section:
- Be a full admin (`userRole === 'admin'`)
- **OR** have complaint admin permission with `can_manage_categories: true`

### To Update Complaint Status:
- Be a full admin (`userRole === 'admin'`)
- **OR** have complaint admin permission with `can_change_status: true`

### Note on Permissions:
These are **separate** permissions:
- `can_manage_categories` = Can create/edit custom statuses (system-wide)
- `can_change_status` = Can update individual complaint statuses (per-complaint)

A user could have one, both, or neither of these permissions.

## Testing Steps

### Test Case 1: Verify Status Management Visibility
**As complaint admin with can_manage_categories permission:**

1. Go to `/dashboard/complaints`
2. Look at the top of the page (above stats cards)
3. ✅ Should see "Custom Status Management" card
4. ✅ Should see list of existing custom statuses
5. ✅ Should see "Create New Status" button

**Expected:** Full status management interface is visible

### Test Case 2: Create Custom Status
**Steps:**
1. Click "Create New Status" button
2. Fill in:
   - Name: "Pending Escalation"
   - Description: "Issue requires escalation to senior team"
   - Display Order: 7
   - Is Active: ✓
3. Click "Create Status"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Success message appears
- ✅ New status appears in the list
- ✅ Status is immediately available in complaint modals

### Test Case 3: Use Custom Status in Complaint
**Steps:**
1. Open any complaint
2. Go to "Actions" tab
3. Scroll to "Update Status" section
4. Click "Select New Status" dropdown
5. Find and select "Pending Escalation"
6. Add notes: "Escalating to senior team for review"
7. Click "Update to: Pending Escalation"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Status updates successfully
- ✅ Notes are saved
- ✅ Complaint shows new status
- ✅ History shows the status change with notes

### Test Case 4: Edit Custom Status
**Steps:**
1. In status management section, find "Pending Escalation"
2. Click edit button
3. Change description to: "Requires immediate senior team attention"
4. Click "Update Status"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Status updates successfully
- ✅ New description appears in list
- ✅ Description shows in status selector (if implemented)

### Test Case 5: Verify Permission-Based Access
**As complaint admin WITHOUT can_manage_categories:**

1. Go to `/dashboard/complaints`
2. Look at top of page

**Expected:**
- ❌ "Custom Status Management" section is NOT visible
- ✅ Rest of dashboard works normally
- ✅ Can still update complaint statuses (if have can_change_status)

---

## UI/UX Improvements

### Clear Permission-Based Visibility
- Users only see features they have permission to use
- No confusing disabled buttons or "access denied" errors
- Features simply appear when permission is granted

### Consistent Status Management
- Same interface for admins and complaint admins
- No separate "complaint admin version" to maintain
- Single source of truth for custom statuses

### Immediate Feedback
- Newly created statuses appear instantly
- No page refresh required
- Changes propagate immediately to all users

---

## Backend API (No Changes Required)

The backend already supported complaint admin access to status management:

**Endpoint:** `/hr/client-complaint-statuses/`
**Permission Class:** `IsAdminOrComplaintAdmin`

**Existing Behavior:**
- ✅ GET requests: Any complaint admin can list statuses
- ✅ POST/PUT/DELETE: Requires `can_manage_categories` permission
- ✅ Returns proper permission denied errors if unauthorized

**Frontend now properly utilizes this existing backend capability.**
