# Wallet and Salary System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Multi-Shift Salary Calculation Improvements
**Problem**: Auto salary calculation wasn't properly handling multiple shifts per employee per day.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced hourly-based salary calculation instead of daily flat rate
- Each shift now calculates salary based on actual hours worked
- Improved overtime calculation using hourly rates
- Better handling of minimum work thresholds

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `add_shift_salary_to_wallet` signal in `signals.py`
- Added hourly rate calculation: `hourly_rate = daily_salary / 8`
- Modified salary calculation to use `hourly_rate * worked_hours`
- Enhanced overtime calculation with proper rates

### 2. ✅ Fixed Empty Wallet Transactions for Admin
**Problem**: When admin viewed employee wallets, transactions showed "No transactions found"

**Solution**:
- Updated legacy `WalletTransactionListView` to use `MultiWalletTransactionSerializer`
- Changed queryset to fetch `MultiWalletTransaction` objects instead of legacy `WalletTransaction`
- Fixed permission checking logic for admin users

**Changes Made**:
- Modified `WalletTransactionListView` in `views.py`
- Changed `get_serializer_class()` to return `MultiWalletTransactionSerializer`
- Updated `get_queryset()` to filter `MultiWalletTransaction.objects`

### 3. ✅ Improved Salary Credit Descriptions  
**Problem**: Salary transaction descriptions showed "Shift salary for None - Shift [UUID]"

**Solution**:
- Replaced `instance.date` with proper date extraction from `check_in` or `attendance`
- Added employee name to descriptions
- Included meaningful shift details (type, hours worked, overtime)
- Updated transaction filtering logic to handle both old and new formats

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed description templates in `signals.py`:
  - Old: `"Shift salary for {instance.date} - Shift {instance.id}"`
  - New: `"Shift salary for {employee.name} - {shift_date} ({instance.shift_type}: {worked_hours:.1f}h{overtime_info})"`
- Updated filtering logic to use `description__contains` for flexible matching
