# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - Client Account System

## âš¡ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Apply Database Changes (1 minute)

```bash
cd /home/ahmedyasser/lab/MicroSystem
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Run Tests (1 minute)

```bash
python test_client_account_system.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ“ PASSED - Client Account Creation
âœ“ PASSED - Existing Client Submission
âœ“ PASSED - Client Complaints Query
âœ“ PASSED - Password Authentication

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!
```

### Step 3: Start Django Server (30 seconds)

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Server running at: `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 4: Test the API (2 minutes)

#### A. Submit a Complaint (Creates Account)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/hr/public/client-complaints/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_name": "John Doe",
    "client_email": "john@example.com",
    "client_phone": "+1234567890",
    "category": 1,
    "priority": "medium",
    "title": "Test Issue",
    "description": "Testing the system"
  }'
```

**Check your terminal** - you'll see the welcome email with the password!

#### B. Login

Copy the password from the email output, then:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/hr/client/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD_FROM_EMAIL"
  }'
```

You'll get back access and refresh tokens!

#### C. Get Dashboard (Replace YOUR_TOKEN with the access token)

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/hr/client/dashboard/stats/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

You'll see the client's dashboard statistics!

## ðŸ“– What Just Happened?

1. âœ… A new client account was automatically created when the complaint was submitted
2. âœ… A secure password was generated and "emailed" (printed to console)
3. âœ… The complaint was linked to the client's account
4. âœ… The client can now log in and view their dashboard
5. âœ… The client can see all their complaints in one place

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### For Backend Testing:
- Try submitting another complaint with the same email (no duplicate account created)
- Test all the API endpoints listed in the documentation
- Try the password change endpoint
- Test the complaint filtering

### For Frontend Development:
1. Open `FRONTEND_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Follow the step-by-step guide
3. Implement the pages one by one:
   - Start with login page
   - Then dashboard
   - Then complaints list
   - Then new complaint form

## ðŸ†˜ Quick Troubleshooting

**Problem: Migrations fail**
```bash
# Try resetting migrations (only in development!)
rm hr_management/migrations/00*.py
python manage.py makemigrations hr_management
python manage.py migrate
```

**Problem: Category ID not found**
```bash
# Create a test category first
python manage.py shell
>>> from hr_management.models import ComplaintCategory
>>> cat = ComplaintCategory.objects.create(name="Technical", description="Tech issues", is_active=True)
>>> print(f"Category ID: {cat.id}")
>>> exit()
```

**Problem: Email not showing**
- Check your terminal/console output
- Email is printed there (console backend for development)

**Problem: Login fails**
- Make sure you copy the EXACT password from the email
- Passwords are case-sensitive
- Check that the user was created: `python manage.py shell` then `from hr_management.models import User; User.objects.filter(role='client')`
