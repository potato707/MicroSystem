## 🚀 How to Test Right Now

### Option 1: Automated Testing Script

Run this command to automatically verify everything:

```bash
cd /home/ahmedyasser/lab/MicroSystem
./test_client_system.sh
```

This script will:
- Check if servers are running
- Run backend tests
- Test API endpoints
- Show test credentials
- Verify all files are in place

### Option 2: Manual Testing

**Step 1: Start Django (if not running)**
```bash
cd /home/ahmedyasser/lab/MicroSystem
python manage.py runserver
```

**Step 2: Start Next.js (in a new terminal)**
```bash
cd /home/ahmedyasser/lab/MicroSystem/v0-micro-system
npm run dev
```

**Step 3: Run Backend Tests**
```bash
cd /home/ahmedyasser/lab/MicroSystem
python test_client_account_system.py
```

This will create a test account and show you the credentials.

**Step 4: Test the Frontend**

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000/client/login**

Use the credentials from Step 3 (or create a new account by submitting a complaint).

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting
```bash
# Check if port 8000 is already in use
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Start Django
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend Not Starting
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is already in use
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Install dependencies
cd v0-micro-system
npm install

# Start Next.js
npm run dev
```

### Cannot Login
1. Make sure you're using the correct password from the test output
2. Try creating a new account by submitting a complaint
3. Check Django console for the generated password

### API Connection Errors
1. Verify Django is running on port 8000
2. Check `.env.local` has: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/hr`
3. Restart Next.js dev server after changing env variables
