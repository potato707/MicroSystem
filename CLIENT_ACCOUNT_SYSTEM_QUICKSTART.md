# Client Account System - Quick Start Guide

## Test the Complete System (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Running
```bash
# In the MicroSystem directory
python manage.py runserver
```

Expected output: `Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

### Step 2: Start Frontend
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd v0-micro-system
npm run dev
```

Expected output: `- Local: http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Test Backend API (Optional)
Run the automated test suite:
```bash
python test_client_account_system.py
```

This will:
- Create a test client account
- Submit a complaint
- Verify account creation
- Test authentication
- Display test credentials

### Step 4: Test Frontend

#### Option A: Use Existing Test Account
If you ran the backend tests, use the credentials shown in the output:
- Email: `testclient@example.com`
- Password: (shown in test output, e.g., `fP5Lwv##om&K`)

#### Option B: Create New Account via Public Form
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/client-portal`
2. Submit a complaint with your email
3. Check Django console for the generated password
4. Use those credentials to login

### Step 5: Login to Client Portal
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/client/login`
2. Enter email and password
3. Click "Sign in"
4. You should be redirected to the dashboard

On the dashboard, you should see:
- Statistics cards (total, pending, in-progress, resolved)
- Recent complaints list
- Buttons to submit new complaint or view all complaints

### Step 7: Submit a New Complaint
1. Click "Submit New Complaint"
2. Fill in the form (contact info should be pre-filled)
3. Select a category and priority
4. Click "Submit Complaint"
5. You should see a success message

### Step 8: View Complaints
1. Click "View All Complaints" from dashboard
2. Try filtering by status or priority
3. Use the search box to search complaints
4. Click on any complaint to view details

### Step 9: View Complaint Details
1. Click on a complaint from the list
2. View full details including:
   - Title and description
