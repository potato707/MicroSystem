## 🎯 Project Objective

Modify the complaint management system so that when a client submits a complaint, an account is automatically created for them, allowing them to log in and view all their complaints in a personal dashboard.

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Backend Model Changes ✅

#### File: `hr_management/models.py`

**User Model:**
- ✅ Added `'client'` role to `ROLE_CHOICES`
- ✅ Clients can now authenticate and access the system

**ClientComplaint Model:**
- ✅ Added `client_user` ForeignKey field
- ✅ Links each complaint to a specific client user account

### 2. Automatic Account Creation ✅

#### File: `hr_management/serializers.py`

**ClientComplaintSubmissionSerializer:**
- ✅ Overridden `create()` method
- ✅ Checks if user exists by email

- ✅ Provides clear instructions

### 3. Client Authentication API ✅

#### File: `hr_management/client_auth_views.py`

**Endpoints Created:**
- ✅ `POST /hr/client/auth/login/` - Login with JWT tokens

### 4. Client Dashboard API ✅

#### File: `hr_management/client_dashboard_views.py`

**Endpoints Created:**

- ✅ `GET /hr/client/complaints/<uuid>/history/` - Status history
- ✅ `POST /hr/client/complaints/submit/` - Submit new complaint
- ✅ `GET /hr/client/categories/` - Available categories

### 5. URL Configuration ✅

#### File: `hr_management/urls.py`

- ✅ Added all client authentication routes
- ✅ Added all client dashboard routes
- ✅ Proper URL naming and organization

### 6. Django Settings ✅

#### File: `MicroSystem/settings.py`

- ✅ Email backend configuration (console for dev)
- ✅ DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL setting
- ✅ CLIENT_DASHBOARD_URL and CLIENT_LOGIN_URL settings

### 7. Test Suite ✅

#### File: `test_client_account_system.py`

**Tests Created:**

---

## 📋 How to Use (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

```bash
cd /home/ahmedyasser/lab/MicroSystem
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Run Backend Tests

```bash
python test_client_account_system.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- ✅ Client Account Creation - PASSED
- ✅ Existing Client Submission - PASSED
- ✅ Client Complaints Query - PASSED
- ✅ Password Authentication - PASSED

### Step 3: Start Django Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Backend API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 4: Test Backend API Manually (Optional)

#### Test 1: Public Complaint Submission (Creates Account)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/hr/public/client-complaints/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_name": "Test User",
    "client_email": "test@example.com",
    "client_phone": "+1234567890",
    "category": 1,
    "priority": "medium",
    "title": "Test Complaint",
    "description": "Testing account creation"
  }'
```

**Check console output for:**
- Welcome email with generated password
- Account creation confirmation

#### Test 2: Client Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/hr/client/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "<password-from-email>"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Login successful",
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "username": "test",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "name": "Test User",
    "role": "client"
  },
  "access": "eyJ0eXAiOi...",
  "refresh": "eyJ0eXAiOi..."
}
```

#### Test 3: Get Dashboard Stats (Authenticated)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/hr/client/dashboard/stats/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>"
```

### Step 5: Implement Frontend (See FRONTEND_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

The frontend implementation guide provides:
- Complete TypeScript type definitions
- API client setup with authentication
- Authentication utilities
- Page-by-page implementation with full code examples:
  - Login page
  - Dashboard page
  - Complaints list page
  - New complaint form
  - Complaint detail page

## 🔄 System Flow

### Flow 1: New Client Submits Complaint (No Account)

```
1. Client visits public form (no login)
   └─> http://yourfrontend.com/submit-complaint

2. Client fills form and submits
   └─> POST /hr/public/client-complaints/

3. Backend automatically:
   ├─> Checks if user exists with that email
   ├─> Creates new User (role='client', auto-generated password)
   ├─> Sends welcome email with credentials
   └─> Links complaint to new user account

4. Client receives email:
   ├─> Username/Email
   ├─> Auto-generated password
   ├─> Login URL
   └─> Dashboard URL

5. Client can now log in
```

### Flow 2: Existing Client Logs In

```
1. Client visits login page
   └─> http://yourfrontend.com/client/login

2. Client enters email + password
   └─> POST /hr/client/auth/login/

3. Backend validates and returns:
   ├─> Access token (JWT)
   ├─> Refresh token
   └─> User information

4. Frontend stores tokens
   └─> localStorage or httpOnly cookies

5. Client accesses dashboard
   └─> GET /hr/client/dashboard/stats/
   └─> GET /hr/client/complaints/
```

### Flow 3: Client Submits Another Complaint (Logged In)

```
1. Client logs in to dashboard

2. Clicks "Submit New Complaint"
   └─> http://yourfrontend.com/client/complaints/new

3. Fills form and submits
   └─> POST /hr/client/complaints/submit/

4. Backend automatically:
   ├─> Uses authenticated user's information
   ├─> Links new complaint to existing account
   ├─> NO new account created
   └─> NO welcome email sent

5. Client sees new complaint in dashboard
```
