# Color Contrast Fix Summary

## Problem
The admin task management table had poor color contrast with:
- Icons using `text-gray-400` (too light)
- Text using default colors (too light) 
- Difficult to read content in task rows

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. **Icon Colors Improved**
- Changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-600` for better visibility:
  - User icons
  - Team icons  
  - Calendar icons
- Status icons kept their semantic colors (green, blue, yellow)
- Default status icon changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-700`

### 2. **Text Colors Enhanced**
- Task titles: Added `text-gray-900` for strong contrast
- Task descriptions: Changed from `text-gray-600` to `text-gray-700`
- Employee names: Added `text-gray-900` 
- Team names: Added `text-gray-900`
- Status labels: Added `text-gray-900`
- Dates: Added `text-gray-900`

### 3. **Interactive Elements**
- Added `transition-colors` for smooth hover effects
- Maintained `hover:bg-gray-50` for subtle row highlighting

## Before vs After Color Mapping

| Element | Before | After | Improvement |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Icons | `text-gray-400` | `text-gray-600` | Much darker, better contrast |
| Task titles | Default | `text-gray-900` | Strong, readable contrast |
| Descriptions | `text-gray-600` | `text-gray-700` | Darker, more legible |
| Data text | Default | `text-gray-900` | High contrast |
| Status icons | Mixed | Semantic + `text-gray-700` | Consistent visibility |

## Result ✅
- All text and icons now have excellent contrast
- Content is clearly readable on both light and hover backgrounds
- Maintains visual hierarchy with appropriate color weights
- Preserves semantic meaning of status colors

The admin task management interface now has proper color contrast and should be easily readable!
