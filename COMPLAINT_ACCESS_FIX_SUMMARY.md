# Complaint Admin Access Fix - Summary

## Issue
Users with complaint admin permissions were getting "permission denied" errors when accessing the complaint statuses endpoint, even though they had been granted permissions.

## Root Cause
`ClientComplaintStatusViewSet` was using `IsAdminUser` permission, which only allowed `role='admin'` users, blocking complaint admins.

## Solution
1. Created `IsAdminOrComplaintAdmin` permission class in `custom_permissions.py`
2. Updated `ClientComplaintStatusViewSet` to use the new permission class
3. Enhanced `ComplaintCategoryViewSet` to allow complaint admins to see all categories

## Files Changed
- `hr_management/custom_permissions.py` - Added new permission class
- `hr_management/views.py` - Updated imports and ViewSet permissions

## Result
✅ Complaint admins can now:
- View all complaint statuses
- View all complaint categories (if they have `can_manage_categories`)
- Create/edit statuses (if they have `can_manage_categories`)
- Access all necessary endpoints for their role

## Testing
Run: `python3 test_complaint_admin_access.py`
Result: ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED (5/5)

## Documentation
See `COMPLAINT_ADMIN_ACCESS_FIX.md` for detailed technical documentation.
