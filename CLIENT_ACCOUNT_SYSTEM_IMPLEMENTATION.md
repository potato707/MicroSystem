# Client Account System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the client account creation and authentication system for the complaint management platform.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Model Changes

#### User Model (`hr_management/models.py`)
- Added `'client'` role to `ROLE_CHOICES`
- Clients can now authenticate and access their own complaints

#### ClientComplaint Model (`hr_management/models.py`)
- Added `client_user` ForeignKey field linking complaints to User accounts
- This allows each complaint to be associated with a client's account

### 2. Automatic Account Creation

#### ClientComplaintSubmissionSerializer (`hr_management/serializers.py`)
- Overridden `create()` method to automatically create client accounts
- **Process:**
  1. Check if a User with the submitted email already exists
  2. If not, create a new User with:
     - Role: `'client'`
     - Auto-generated secure password (12 characters, letters + digits + special chars)
     - Username derived from email
  3. Send welcome email with login credentials
  4. Link the complaint to the client user account

#### Welcome Email
- Sent automatically when new client account is created
- Contains:
  - Login credentials (email and password)
  - Dashboard URL
  - Login URL
  - Instructions for first-time login
- Uses both plain text and HTML formats

### 3. Client Authentication Endpoints

#### Created: `hr_management/client_auth_views.py`
Contains the following views:

1. **ClientLoginView** (`POST /hr/client/auth/login/`)
   - Email and password authentication
   - Returns JWT tokens (access + refresh)
   - Validates that user has 'client' role
   - Returns user data and tokens

2. **ClientLogoutView** (`POST /hr/client/auth/logout/`)
   - Blacklists refresh token
   - Requires authentication

3. **ClientCurrentUserView** (`GET /hr/client/auth/me/`)
   - Returns current logged-in client's information
   - Includes complaint statistics (total, pending, resolved)

4. **ClientChangePasswordView** (`POST /hr/client/auth/change-password/`)
   - Allows clients to change their password
   - Validates current password
   - Enforces minimum password length

5. **ClientProfileUpdateView** (`PATCH /hr/client/auth/profile/`)
   - Allows clients to update name and profile picture

### 4. Client Dashboard API Endpoints

#### Created: `hr_management/client_dashboard_views.py`
Contains the following views:

1. **ClientDashboardStatsView** (`GET /hr/client/dashboard/stats/`)
   - Dashboard statistics for logged-in client
   - Breakdown by status (pending, approved, in_progress, resolved, closed, rejected)
   - Breakdown by priority (urgent, medium, low)
   - Recent 5 complaints

2. **ClientComplaintsListView** (`GET /hr/client/complaints/`)
   - List all complaints for logged-in client
   - Supports filtering by:
     - Status
     - Priority
     - Category
     - Search (title/description)
   - Paginated results (10 per page, configurable)
   - Ordered by creation date (newest first)

3. **ClientComplaintDetailView** (`GET /hr/client/complaints/<uuid>/`)
   - Get detailed information about a specific complaint
   - Verifies complaint belongs to logged-in client
   - Includes all related data (attachments, tasks, comments, history)

4. **ClientSubmitComplaintView** (`POST /hr/client/complaints/submit/`)
   - Allows logged-in clients to submit new complaints
   - Auto-fills client information from authenticated user
   - Links complaint to current user
   - Creates status history entry

5. **ClientAvailableCategoriesView** (`GET /hr/client/categories/`)
   - Returns list of active complaint categories
   - Used for dropdown in complaint submission form

6. **ClientComplaintStatusHistoryView** (`GET /hr/client/complaints/<uuid>/history/`)
   - Get status change history for a specific complaint
   - Verifies complaint belongs to logged-in client
   - Shows who changed status and when

### 5. URL Configuration

#### Updated: `hr_management/urls.py`
Added the following URL patterns:

**Client Authentication:**
- `POST /hr/client/auth/login/` - Client login
- `POST /hr/client/auth/logout/` - Client logout
- `GET /hr/client/auth/me/` - Get current client user
- `POST /hr/client/auth/change-password/` - Change password
- `PATCH /hr/client/auth/profile/` - Update profile

**Client Dashboard:**
- `GET /hr/client/dashboard/stats/` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /hr/client/complaints/` - List complaints (with filters)
- `GET /hr/client/complaints/<uuid>/` - Complaint details
- `GET /hr/client/complaints/<uuid>/history/` - Status history
- `POST /hr/client/complaints/submit/` - Submit new complaint
- `GET /hr/client/categories/` - Available categories

### 6. Django Settings

#### Updated: `MicroSystem/settings.py`
Added email configuration:
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'  # For development
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'noreply@company.com'
CLIENT_DASHBOARD_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/client/dashboard'
CLIENT_LOGIN_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/client/login'
```

### 7. Test Script

#### Created: `test_client_account_system.py`
Comprehensive test suite that verifies:
1. Client account auto-creation on complaint submission
2. No duplicate accounts for existing clients
3. Complaint linking to client users
4. Email notification sending
5. Multiple complaints per client

## How It Works

### Flow 1: New Client Submits Complaint (Public)
1. Client visits public complaint form (no login required)
2. Fills out complaint details including email
3. Submits complaint via `POST /hr/public/client-complaints/`
4. **Backend automatically:**
   - Checks if user with that email exists
   - Creates new client account with auto-generated password
   - Sends welcome email with login credentials
   - Links complaint to the new user account
5. Client receives email with login details

### Flow 2: Client Logs In and Views Dashboard
1. Client visits login page
2. Enters email and password (from welcome email)
3. Frontend calls `POST /hr/client/auth/login/`
4. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT tokens
5. Frontend stores tokens and navigates to dashboard
6. Dashboard calls `GET /hr/client/dashboard/stats/` and `GET /hr/client/complaints/`
7. Client sees all their complaints and statistics

### Flow 3: Existing Client Submits New Complaint
1. Client logs in to dashboard
2. Clicks "Submit New Complaint"
3. Fills out complaint form
4. Frontend calls `POST /hr/client/complaints/submit/`
5. **Backend automatically:**
   - Uses authenticated user's information
   - Links new complaint to existing account
   - NO new account created
   - NO welcome email sent

## Database Migrations Required

Run these commands to apply the model changes:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Testing the Backend

### Option 1: Automated Test Script
```bash
python test_client_account_system.py
```

### Option 2: Manual API Testing

#### Test 1: Public Complaint Submission (Creates Account)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/hr/public/client-complaints/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_name": "John Doe",
    "client_email": "john@example.com",
    "client_phone": "+1234567890",
    "category": 1,
    "priority": "medium",
    "title": "Test Complaint",
    "description": "This is a test"
  }'
```
**Expected:** Account created, email sent to console, complaint linked to new user

#### Test 2: Client Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/hr/client/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "<password-from-email>"
  }'
```
**Expected:** Returns access token, refresh token, and user data

#### Test 3: Get Dashboard Stats (Authenticated)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/hr/client/dashboard/stats/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>"
```
**Expected:** Returns complaint statistics for logged-in client

#### Test 4: List Client's Complaints (Authenticated)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/hr/client/complaints/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access-token>"
```
**Expected:** Returns paginated list of complaints for logged-in client

## Frontend Implementation (Next Steps)

### Required Frontend Pages

1. **Client Login Page** (`/client/login`)
   - Email and password inputs
   - Calls `POST /hr/client/auth/login/`
   - Stores JWT tokens in localStorage/cookies
   - Redirects to dashboard on success

2. **Client Dashboard** (`/client/dashboard`)
   - Shows statistics (total, pending, resolved complaints)
   - Lists all client's complaints
   - Filters by status, priority, category
   - Search functionality
   - Links to detailed complaint view

3. **Complaint Detail Page** (`/client/complaints/[id]`)
   - Shows full complaint information
   - Status history timeline
   - Task progress
   - Attachments
   - Communication thread

4. **New Complaint Form** (`/client/complaints/new`)
   - Form to submit new complaint
   - Category selection
   - Priority selection
   - File upload support
   - Auto-fills client info from authenticated user

5. **Client Profile Page** (`/client/profile`)
   - View/edit profile information
   - Change password form
   - View account statistics

### Example Frontend Code Structure

```
/client
  /login
    page.tsx          # Login page
  /dashboard
    page.tsx          # Dashboard with stats
  /complaints
    page.tsx          # List of complaints
    /[id]
      page.tsx        # Complaint detail
    /new
      page.tsx        # Submit new complaint
  /profile
    page.tsx          # Profile and settings
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Security:**
   - Passwords are auto-generated with 12 characters
   - Include letters, digits, and special characters
   - Stored using Django's password hashing (PBKDF2)
   - Clients can change password after first login

2. **Authentication:**
   - JWT tokens for stateless authentication
   - Refresh token for token renewal
   - Token blacklisting on logout

3. **Authorization:**
   - All client endpoints verify user role is 'client'
   - Complaint queries filter by `client_user` to ensure clients only see their own data
   - No cross-client data leakage

4. **Email Security:**
   - Uses console backend for development
   - Configure SMTP with TLS for production
   - Consider password reset flow for lost credentials

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Configure real SMTP email backend in settings.py
- [ ] Set up email templates with company branding
- [ ] Update CLIENT_DASHBOARD_URL and CLIENT_LOGIN_URL to production URLs
- [ ] Enable JWT token blacklisting (install djangorestframework-simplejwt[blacklist])
- [ ] Add rate limiting to login endpoint
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Set up email verification (optional)
- [ ] Add HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Configure CORS properly for frontend domain
- [ ] Add logging for security events (logins, failed attempts)
