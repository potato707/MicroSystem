✓ test_password_authentication
  - Generated password works
  - JWT token returned
  - User data correct
```

**Test Credentials**:
- Email: testclient@example.com

## How It Works

### New Client Flow
1. Client submits complaint via public form
2. System checks if email exists
3. If new:
   - Creates user account with 'client' role
   - Generates secure random password
   - Sends welcome email with credentials
4. Links complaint to user account
5. Client receives email with login instructions
6. Client logs in at `/client/login`
7. Redirected to dashboard

### Existing Client Flow
1. Client logs in with credentials
2. JWT tokens issued (access + refresh)
3. Tokens stored in localStorage
4. All API requests include bearer token
5. Backend validates token and identifies user
6. Data filtered automatically by user
7. Client can view/manage their complaints

### API Request Flow
```
Frontend (Next.js)
  ↓
clientApi function
  ↓
Add Authorization header (Bearer token)
  ↓
Django Backend
  ↓
JWT Authentication Middleware
  ↓
IsAuthenticated Permission
  ↓
Filter by request.user
  ↓
Return data
  ↓
Frontend displays
```
