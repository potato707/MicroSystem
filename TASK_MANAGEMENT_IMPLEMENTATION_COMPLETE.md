# Task Management Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive task management enhancements with role-based access control and improved subtask assignment workflow.

## 1. Enhanced Subtask Assignment Logic ✅

### Implementation Details
**File**: `v0-micro-system/components/task-dialog.tsx`

### Features Implemented:
- **Smart Assignment Logic**: Subtask assignment options now dynamically change based on:
  - **Team Selection**: When a team is selected, only team members are shown in assignment dropdown
  - **No Team + Admin Role**: Admins can assign to any employee in the system
  - **No Team + Non-Admin**: Regular employees can only assign to themselves

### Code Changes:
```typescript
// Enhanced subtask assignment logic
if (formData.team && teamMembers.length > 0) {
  // Team selected: show team members
  return teamMembers.map((employee) => (
    <SelectItem key={employee.id} value={employee.id}>
      {employee.name}
    </SelectItem>
  ))
} else if (!formData.team && currentUser?.role === 'admin') {
  // No team + admin: show all employees
  return employees.map((employee) => (
    <SelectItem key={employee.id} value={employee.id}>
      {employee.name}
    </SelectItem>
  ))
} else if (!formData.team && currentUser) {
  // No team + non-admin: only show current user
  return (
    <SelectItem key={currentUser.id} value={currentUser.id}>
      {currentUser.name}
    </SelectItem>
  )
}
```

## 2. Admin Task Management System ✅

### Backend API Implementation
**File**: `hr_management/views.py`

### New Endpoint: `/hr/tasks/manage/`
**Features**:
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search, status, priority, employee, team, date ranges
- **Sorting**: Multiple fields with ascending/descending order
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large task lists
- **Role-Based Access**: 
  - Admins: See all tasks system-wide
  - Team Managers: See tasks from managed teams + own tasks
  - Regular Employees: No access (returns empty queryset)

### API Parameters:
```python
# Supported query parameters
params = {
    'search': 'text',          # Search in title, description, employee, team
    'status': 'in_progress',   # Filter by status
    'priority': 'high',        # Filter by priority
    'employee_id': 'uuid',     # Filter by specific employee
    'team_id': 'uuid',         # Filter by specific team
    'date_from': '2024-01-01', # Date range start
    'date_to': '2024-01-31',   # Date range end
    'sort_by': 'created_at',   # Sort field
    'sort_order': 'desc',      # Sort direction
    'page': 1,                 # Page number
    'page_size': 10            # Items per page
