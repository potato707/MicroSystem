# Complaint Actions Access Fix - Summary

## Issue
Users with complaint admin permissions were seeing "No actions available" in the complaint detail modal's Actions tab, even though they had been granted the necessary permissions.

## Root Causes
1. **Incorrect permission logic**: Actions required admin permissions AND specific permissions, blocking admins
2. **Wrong display condition**: "No actions" message was shown for all employees, ignoring complaint admin permissions

## Solution
1. Fixed `canAssign` and `canUpdateStatus` logic to properly handle both admins and complaint admins
2. Updated "No actions" condition to check for complaint admin permissions

## Files Changed
- `v0-micro-system/components/complaints/complaint-detail-modal.tsx`
  - Lines 73-77: Updated permission check logic
  - Line 1335: Updated "No actions" display condition

## Result
✅ Complaint admins can now:
- Review complaints (approve/reject)
- Assign complaints to teams/employees (if they have `can_assign`)
- Update complaint status (if they have `can_change_status`)  
- See appropriate action buttons based on their permissions
- No more "No actions available" when they have permissions

✅ Regular employees without permissions still see "No actions available"
✅ Admin users maintain full access
✅ Permissions work end-to-end (backend + frontend)
