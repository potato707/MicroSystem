# Authentication Redirect System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive authentication system that automatically redirects unauthenticated users to the login page when they try to access protected routes like the dashboard.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Next.js Middleware (`/v0-micro-system/middleware.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Server-side route protection
- **Features**:
  - Checks for authentication token in cookies or headers
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` with redirect parameter
  - Prevents authenticated users from accessing login page
  - Protects all `/dashboard/*` routes

### 2. Authentication Context Provider (`/v0-micro-system/components/auth-provider.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Client-side authentication state management
- **Features**:
  - React Context for global authentication state
  - Automatic token validation on app start
  - User data fetching and caching
  - Login/logout functionality
  - Automatic redirect handling
  - Cookie-based token storage for middleware compatibility

### 3. Enhanced API Client (`/v0-micro-system/lib/api.ts`)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic 401 handling with redirect to login
  - Enhanced error messages from API responses
  - Automatic token clearing on authentication failure

### 4. Updated Components
- **Root Layout**: Wrapped with AuthProvider
- **Dashboard Layout**: Protected with authentication check and loading state
- **Login Page**: Integrated with auth context for automatic redirect handling
- **Sidebar**: Uses auth context for user data and logout functionality
- **Home Page**: Automatic redirect based on authentication status

## Authentication Flow

### For Unauthenticated Users:
1. User tries to access `/dashboard` (or any protected route)
2. Next.js middleware checks for token - none found
3. User redirected to `/login?redirect=/dashboard`
4. User logs in successfully
5. AuthProvider stores token in localStorage and cookie
6. User automatically redirected to original intended route (`/dashboard`)

### For Authenticated Users:
1. App loads and AuthProvider checks for existing token
2. If valid token found, user data is fetched
3. User can access all protected routes
4. If user tries to access `/login`, they're redirected to dashboard
5. On logout, tokens are cleared and user redirected to login

### API Error Handling:
1. API calls include JWT token in Authorization header
2. If server returns 401 (token expired/invalid):
   - Token is automatically cleared
   - User redirected to login with current page as redirect parameter
   - User sees error message and can re-authenticate

## Security Features

### Token Management:
- JWT tokens stored in both localStorage (for client) and cookies (for middleware)
- Automatic token clearing on logout or authentication failure
- Token validation on app initialization

### Route Protection:
- Server-side protection via Next.js middleware
- Client-side protection via React Context
- Loading states prevent flash of unauthenticated content
- Proper redirect chain preserves user intent

### Employee Status Integration:
- Backend authentication already validates employee status
- Only active employees can login (existing feature)
- Admin users without employee records can still access system
- Inactive employees are blocked with proper error messages

## Benefits

### User Experience:
- Seamless redirect flow - users always end up where they intended
- No flash of unauthenticated content
- Clear loading states during authentication checks
- Proper error messages for authentication failures

### Security:
- Multiple layers of protection (server + client)
- Automatic token cleanup prevents stale authentication
- Protected routes cannot be accessed without valid authentication
- Employee status validation prevents inactive accounts from accessing system

### Developer Experience:
- Clean separation of concerns with React Context
- Reusable authentication logic across components
- Proper TypeScript types for authentication state
- Easy to extend for additional authentication features

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- ✅ Backend authentication with employee status validation
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Active employee login success
- ✅ Inactive employee login blocking
- ✅ Admin user access preservation

## Usage

### For Components:
```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@/components/auth-provider'

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, logout } = useAuth()
  
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />
  if (!isAuthenticated) return null // Will redirect automatically
  
  return <div>Welcome {user?.name}</div>
}
```

### For API Calls:
```tsx
// API client automatically handles authentication
const data = await api.getCurrentUser() // Includes JWT token
// If 401 response, user is automatically redirected to login
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Token refresh functionality for longer sessions
- Remember me functionality
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Role-based route protection beyond employee status
- Audit logging for authentication events

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `/v0-micro-system/middleware.ts` - Next.js middleware for route protection
- `/v0-micro-system/components/auth-provider.tsx` - Authentication context
- `/v0-micro-system/test_auth_redirect.py` - Backend authentication tests

### Modified:
- `/v0-micro-system/app/layout.tsx` - Added AuthProvider wrapper
- `/v0-micro-system/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Added authentication protection
- `/v0-micro-system/app/login/page.tsx` - Integrated with auth context
- `/v0-micro-system/app/page.tsx` - Added authentication-based routing
- `/v0-micro-system/components/sidebar.tsx` - Uses auth context for user data
- `/v0-micro-system/lib/api.ts` - Enhanced 401 handling

The authentication redirect system is now fully implemented and provides comprehensive protection for the application while maintaining a smooth user experience.
